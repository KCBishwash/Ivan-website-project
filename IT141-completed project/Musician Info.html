			<p>Ian Ernest Gilmore "Gil" Evans (born Green; May 13, 1912 – March 20, 1988)[1] was a Canadian jazz pianist, arranger, composer and bandleader. 
			He is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz and jazz fusion. He is best known for his acclaimed collaborations with Miles Davis.</p>

				<h1>Early Life</h1>
					<p> Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, his name was changed early on from Green to Evans, the name of his stepfather. 
					His family moved to Stockton, California where he spent most of his youth. After 1946, he lived and worked primarily in New York City, living for many years at Westbeth Artists Community</p>

				<h1>Career</h1>
				<p>Between 1941 and 1948, Evans worked as an arranger for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. 
				Even then, early in his career, his arrangements were such a challenge to musicians that bassist Bill Crow recalled that bandleader Thornhill would bring out Evans’s arrangements “when he wanted to punish the band." 
				Evans' modest basement apartment behind a New York City Chinese laundry soon became a meeting place for musicians looking to develop new musical styles outside of the dominant bebop style of the day. 
				Those present included the leading bebop performer, Charlie Parker, as well as Gerry Mulligan and John Carisi. In 1948, Evans, with Miles Davis, Mulligan, and others, collaborated on a band book for a nonet. 
				These ensembles, larger than the trio-to-quintet "combos", but smaller than the "big bands" which were on the brink of economic unviability, allowed arrangers to have a larger palette of colors by using French horns and tuba. 
				Claude Thornhill had employed hornist John Graas in 1942, and composer-arranger Bob Graettinger had scored for horns and tubas with the Stan Kenton orchestra, but the "Kenton sound" was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided.

				<h1>Personal Life</h1>
				<p>Evans first married following the 1949 Birth of the Cool recording sessions and was survived by his second wife Anita (Cooper) and two children, Noah and Miles. His son Miles played trumpet in his Monday Night Orchestra.
				   Evans died of peritonitis in Cuernavaca, Mexico at the age of 75

				<h1>Death and Legacy </h1>
				<p>Following a brief illness, Michelangelo died on February 18, 1564—just weeks before his 89th birthday—at his home in Macel de'Corvi, Rome. A nephew bore his body back to Florence, where he was revered by the public as the "father and master of all the arts," and was laid to rest at the Basilica di Santa Croce—his chosen place of burial.</p>
				<p>Unlike many artists, Michelangelo achieved fame and wealth during his lifetime. He also had the peculiar distinction of living to see the publication of two biographies about his life (written by Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi). Appreciation of Michelangelo's artistic mastery has endured for centuries, and his name has become synonymous with the best of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
