			<h2>100 Best Jazz Recordings</h2>
			<div class="sub-content">
				
				<p>Recorded jazz is still under a century old, but in a little over nine decades an enormous quantity of music has amassed. 
				To absorb and assess even a substantial proportion of it requires a lifetime of listening. 
				What follows is a strictly chronological roll-call of acknowledged jazz masterpieces, together with – it is hoped – some outstanding performances that will be less familiar even to a dedicated fan</p>			
				<h3>Recordings</h3>
				
				
				
				<p>1 King Oliver: King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set (1923-24) Retrieval
					<br>
					Listen through the dim and distant acoustic sound – the first great series of jazz recordings – and you will encounter the intricate and joyous sound of New Orleans at its absolute peak.
					<br>
					<br>
					2 Bessie Smith: Complete Recordings (Frog Vols 1-8 1923-33),
					<br>
					
					Bessie Smith’s recording of the Twenties – accompanied by such musicians as Louis Armstrong, James P Johnson and the sweet-toned trumpeter Joe Smith – have a matchless stateliness of delivery and monumental vocal strength.
					<br>
					<br>
					3 Bix Beiderbecke: Bix & Tram (JSP 1926-29)
					<br>
					Beiderbecke was the doomed Scott Fitzgerald of music. But before the whisky killed him, he introduced a new mood into jazz – romantic, wistful – on these performances with the saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer.
					<br>
					<br>
					4 Jelly Roll Morton: Volumes 1-5 (JSP 1926-1930)
					<br>
					Jelly Roll was a pool-shark, hustler and pimp, but also the finest pianist to come out of New Orleans and the first great composer/arranger in jazz, above all in these recordings.
					<br>
					<br>
					5 Johnny Dodds: Definitive Dodds (Retrieval 1926-7)
					<br>
					Skirling and insistent in the upper register, plumy and fluid in the lower, Dodds’s clarinet was among the most compelling voices to emerge from New Orleans.
					<br>
					<br>
					6 Louis Armstrong: The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings (Columbia 1925-9)
					The Old Testament of jazz in which the youthful Louis Armstrong emerges like a prophet, filled with power and glorious eloquence. His example influenced almost all of 20th-century popular music.
					<br>
					<br>
					7 Fletcher Henderson: Tidal Wave (GPR 1930
					With performances such as Down South Camp Meetin’ (included on this), Henderson’s band led the way to the big era. He also employed some of the best soloists in New York, Coleman Hawkins among them.
					<br>
					<br>
					8 Duke Ellington: Masterpieces 1926-1949 (Proper Box 25)
					It’s impossible to choose from the cornucopia of magnificent explorations of mood and tone-colour that Duke recorded between the late Twenties and the mid-Forties. This compilation has many of the best.
					<br>
					<br>
					9 Spike Hughes & Benny Carter: 1933 (Retrieval)
					The British arranger produced some of the most beguiling arrangements of the early swing era, performed in New York with magnificent solos from Carter, Coleman Hawkins, and the trombonist Dicky Wells.
					<br>
					<br>
					10 Count Basie: The Original American Decca Recordings (MCA 1937-39)
					Basie’s big band had a propulsive beat, a cluster of great soloists and the easy grace of a much smaller group. Seven decades later, this music still sounds fresh minted.
					<br>
					<br>
					11 Billie Holiday & Lester Young: A Musical Romance (Columbia 1937-57)
					Holiday’s voice and Young’s saxophone made a wonderfully compatible musical couple, both wry, tender, vulnerable and beautiful. This compilation contains some of their most delightful encounters, plus one poignant reunion.
					<br>
					<br>
					12 Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli: Swing from Paris (ASV 1935-39)
					Reinhardt’s Roma guitar and Grappelli’s lilting violin both draw on European musical traditions, but fuse with American jazz in a combination that is propulsive, filled with joie de vivre and is just irresistible.
					<br>
					<br>
					13 Benny Goodman: At Carnegie Hall 1938 (Columbia 1938)
					This renowned concert marked the arrival of big-band jazz as the major form in popular music. It also includes a spontaneous masterpiece in the piano improvisation by Jess Stacy on Sing, Sing, Sing.
					<br>
					<br>
					14 Fats Waller: The Best of Fats Waller (RCA 1929-42)
					Waller was a master pianist in the driving Harlem style known as 'stride’, but he was also a great spirit: carefree, insouciant and Falstaffian.
					<br>
					<br>
					15 Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra: 1938-9 (Classics)
					Hampton, the first vibes virtuoso, was the leader on some of the most infectiously high-spirited small-group jazz recordings of the swing era featuring various star soloists.
					<br>
					<br>
					16 Coleman Hawkins: Body and Soul: The Complete Victor Recordings 1939-56 (RCA)
					Hawkins was the first to make great jazz on the tenor saxophone and the first master of the romantic ballad, never more opulently than in his 1939 performance of Body and Soul.
					<br>
					<br>
					17 Sidney Bechet: Jazz Classics Vols 1 & 2 (1939-51)
					Bechet, a clarinettist and soprano saxophonist, had, to a greater extent than any other performer, that mixture of arrogance, elation and power known as the 'rooster crow’.
					<br>
					<br>
					18 Jelly Roll Morton: The Library of Congress Recordings (Rounder 1938)
					Jelly Roll’s reminiscences, spoken, sung and played into a microphone are a unique autobiography in sound – colourful, outrageous, boastful, beautiful and a piece of Americana to rank with Huckleberry Finn.
					<br>
					<br>
					19 Lester Young: The Lester Young Story (Proper Box 1939-49)
					The tenor saxophonist brought a new sensibility into big-band swing – in short, he invented musical cool. His early recordings, mostly on here, remain extraordinarily fresh.
					<br>
					<br>
					20 Charlie Christian: The Genius of the Electric Guitar (Sony Legacy 1939-41)
					Christian had a tantalisingly brief career during which he effectively introduced a new instrument – the electric guitar – into jazz and a distinctive style, punchy and declamatory. Every note he played was memorable.
